The client for our project is built using Facebook's Create-React-App (for now,
we'll see if we'll keep it)

To start the client in dev mode, make sure you have installed npm version 5.2 or higher,
and nodejs version >=6. Then open up a terminal, change your folder path
to ./client , and run "npm install" (that may take a few minutes).

Afterwards, run "npm start", and you should have a server up and running on
localhost:3030 (feel free to change the port in package.json).
